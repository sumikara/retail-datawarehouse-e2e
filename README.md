# Retail E2E Data Warehouse (PostgreSQL)

End-to-end retail data warehouse in PostgreSQL with ETL, dimensional modeling (star/snowflake), Python data profiling, and data quality checks.

## Status
In progress — scripts and documentation are being migrated and organized.

## Repository structure (high level)
- `sql/` – ETL and modeling scripts organized by layers
- `docs/` – engineering notes and decisions (performance, modeling, data quality)
- `diagrams/` – ERD and other visuals

> Detailed dataset notes and run instructions will be added after the script migration is complete.
